# Challenge: Dependency Injection
In this lab you are expected to make use of Dependency Injection for the following use cases:
- Writing to a Logger
- Accessing Configuration from appsettings.ini
- Accessing the HTTP Context in a class used by a Web Controller
- Some other custom use of Dependency Injection (Both Singleton and Scoped.)

For this tutorial you will be using the following links:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection?view=aspnetcore-2.2
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/?view=aspnetcore-2.2
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-2.2
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-context?view=aspnetcore-2.2

Please Google and find your answers! There's plenty out there and the links above may be confusing so its always great to keep searching!

You may want to check what Singleton vs Scoped vs Transient mean.

Tips:
- You may want to have the C# Extension installed
- You can install an auto-using extension that will help getting your using statements loaded
